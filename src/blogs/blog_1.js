      "The pandemic gave an opportunity to the teachers and students to participate in  various events which otherwise were restricted due to time as well as distance for  example one of the students participated in a virtual interschool student conference  within the comforts of his home. Teachers attended the In-house Virtual  Workshops as well as CBSE CoE workshops. These virtual workshops helped the  teachers to gain knowledge and understand the nuances of remote learning. The in-house workshops organized by the Management in the month of May gave  opportunity to the teachers to become mentors in a specific subject or topic. This  further enhanced the confidence level of all the teachers which reflected in their  delivery while conducting the virtual classes. "

      "Every class has Students who are shy in nature and hesitant to ask questions. The  virtual world gave these students an opportunity to open up and helped them to  overcome their diffidence thereby making them more confident. There were also  many students in different classes who were affected by the pandemic wherein  somebody or the other at their respective homes caught the infection. The teachers  of our school allowed these students to attend to their elders and ensured that they  were given extra classes to cover the topics that they had missed. This brought in a  culture of empathy amongst the students.Every class has Students who are shy in nature and hesitant to ask questions.

      "However transitioning to an online mode has its share of challenges. During the  beginning of the pandemic we faced a challenge wherein many students did not  have a required device to attend the classes. Our teachers went out of their way to  speak to the parents of these students and convinced them to invest in a device for  the better future of their ward. The other challenge we faced was availability of  information and answers at the click of the button. Initially we found majority of  the students writing similar answers to a particular question. We overcame this  challenge by providing required training to the teachers to redesign questions and  reset their assessments which is competent and answers are not available at a mere  search. More over the answers are creative and less stressful. "
